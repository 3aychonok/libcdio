This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and
control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and
device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.

Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
disc images as though they were CD's.

Immediate uses are VCDImager, a navigation-capable Video CD plugin
and CD-DA plugin for the media player xine.

A sample utility, cdinfo, is included which displayings CD info. 

If libcddb (http://libcddb.sourceforge.net) is available, the cdinfo
program will display CDDB matches on CD-DA discs.
