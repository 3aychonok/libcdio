	* NEWS: Note library symbol versioning (from Nicolas Boullis).

2004-02-11 20:46  rocky

	* lib/Makefile.am: code reorganization from Nicolas Boullis.

2004-02-10 22:09  rocky

	* lib/Makefile.am: lib/Makefile.am (Nicolas Boullis):
	
	Mostly some cleanup... First, this tries to keep the versioning
	separated from the rest of the Makefile. I used the "foo := $(foo)
	bar" syntax rather than "foo += bar" as I think the += is not
	available on all versions of make.
	
	Moreover, I replaced "$(LIBCDIO_LIBS)" with "libcdio.la" as
	"$(LIBCDIO_LIBS)" is "../lib/libcdio.la". That make a difference if
	you try to build libiso9660.la while libcdio.la is not available.
	Make knows how to make libcdio.la but not ../lib/libcdio.la.

2004-02-10 21:53  rocky

	* lib/.cvsignore: Igore library version file.

2004-02-09 20:38  rocky

	cdio_private.h, iso9660_fs.c: More valgrind-found memory leaks.

	IoControl out of _win_32 and into win32ioctl.

2004-02-04 06:08  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_win32.c, _cdio_win32.h, win32ioctl.c: More cleanup.
	Still sucks.

2004-02-04 05:23  rocky

	* lib/: Makefile.am, _cdio_win32.c, _cdio_win32.h, win32ioctl.c:
	Add better DeviceIocontrol support. It still sucks, but sucks less.

2004-02-01 23:36  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Remove duplicate assignment

2004-01-03 08:50  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: More guesses as to NRG format. Guess blocksizes,
	handle some mixed-mode CDs.

2003-12-30 23:41  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: Some code consolidation.

2003-12-30 22:09  rocky

2003-12-30 06:52  rocky

	* doc/Makefile.am, include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660_fs.c,
	src/cd-info.c: iso9600_stat now has filename inside it. 
	iso9660_fs_readdir now returns a list of iso9660_stat_t's rather
	than filenames.
	
	This should reduce by a small amount the number of CD reads since
	we store more information in the iso9660_fs_readdir return.
	
	However all of this is in preparation for greatly reducing the
	number of CD reads when picking out segment lsn information.

2003-11-11 07:46  rocky

	* doc/libcdio.texi: libcdio.info was missing a @dircategory and
	@direntry section.
	
	See
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=6470&group_id=3845
	
	Thanks to dweimer for pointing this out and providing a patch.

2003-11-09 23:01  rocky

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660_fs.c: Smallish cosmetic
	changes. Bigger ones to iso9660_fs_readdir will probably occur
	later...

2003-09-01 18:51  rocky

2003-08-31 22:05  rocky

2003-08-31 22:04  rocky

2003-08-31 22:02  rocky

	* test/: check_cue.sh.in, check_nrg.sh.in: Was setting options all
	wrong and using wrong CDDB subtitution variable.  As Bullwinkle
	says, "This time, for sure!"

2003-08-31 22:02  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Wasn't noting that we read TOC so we were
	re-reading it every time.

2003-08-31 16:56  rocky

	* src/cd-info.c: Deal with gcc warning. Think it was spurious, but
	just in case.

	test/cdda.right, test/check_cue.sh.in, test/check_nrg.sh.in,
	test/monvoisin.right, test/vcd_demo.right: I think I have the XA
	encapsulation down so that it will work in vcdimager (and others).

2003-08-31 04:03  rocky

	* configure.ac: Rely more on PKG_INFO and remove header checks
	which didn't test for --enable-xxx.

2003-08-31 03:39  rocky

	* include/cdio/: Makefile.am, iso9660.h, xa.h: Separate and make XA

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/iso9660.c, lib/iso9660_private.h,
	test/check_sizeof.c: Expose primary volume descriptor (pvd) and
	directory structures since they *are* part of the spec. and be done
	with it.

2003-08-31 00:02  rocky

	* src/cd-info.c: A tad closer to being able to print ISO-9660
	filesystems

2003-08-30 23:35  rocky

	* include/cdio/iso9660.h, lib/cd_types.c, lib/iso9660_private.h:

	ones public to reduce "private" use in vcdimager.

2003-08-30 22:51  rocky

2003-04-20 11:35  rocky

	* include/cdio/cdio.h: add min/max device driver

2003-04-20 11:34  rocky

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, lib/cdio.c: Add small cdda test. 
	cdio.c: cdio_open was opening image drivers.

2003-04-19 21:39  rocky

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, src/cdinfo.c: Put back
	in libcddb 0.9.0 checking and use cddb_http_disable().

2003-04-19 16:49  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Add _cdio_read_audio_sector. Try to sync up
	with other drivers.

2003-04-19 15:12  rocky

	* Makefile.am, NEWS, configure.ac: Break most of the larger
	regression tests into a separate package.

2003-04-19 05:13  rocky

	* include/cdio/: Makefile.am, cdio.h, cdio.h.in: Add package
	version

2003-04-19 05:02  rocky

	* include/cdio/cdio.h: Add an API version number.

2003-04-19 04:29  rocky

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am, configure.ac, include/.cvsignore,
	include/Makefile.am, include/cdio/.cvsignore,
	include/cdio/Makefile.am, include/cdio/cdio.h,
	include/cdio/logging.h, include/cdio/sector.h,
	include/cdio/types.h, include/cdio/util.h, lib/Makefile.am,
	lib/cdio.h, lib/logging.h, lib/sector.h, lib/types.h, lib/util.h,
	src/cdinfo.c: Move public includes to include/cdio. This should
	facilitate having this source installed locally since it allows
	#include <cdio/cdio.h> in the source tree.

2003-04-18 20:53  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: Revise to to handle libcddb 0.90.

2003-04-18 20:52  rocky

	* lib/cdio.h: Remove a compile warning noticed by Kris Verbeeck.

2003-04-18 20:50  rocky

	* configure.ac: do chmod +x for test/check_opts.sh Test to see if
	we have new enough libcddb.

2003-04-18 20:49  rocky

	* README: Update to include CDDB information and note this is ued
	by CD-DA plugin.

2003-04-15 01:19  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Remove compile warning on non-GNU/Linux
	servers.

2003-04-14 19:30  rocky

	* THANKS: Need to start *somewhere*.

2003-04-14 19:29  rocky

	* NEWS: Wha's happenin'

2003-04-14 19:11  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Bug-causing typo.

2003-04-14 06:03  rocky

	* configure.ac: Need to conditionally add --no-cddb so we added
	check_opts.sh.in.  Rewrite for loop in lower-level Bourne-shell
	style.

2003-04-14 06:01  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: One cddb reference not conditionally included.

2003-04-14 00:58  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: libpopt options need to be integers. Change order
	of include to accomodate libcddb. Make distcheck now works.

2003-04-14 00:29  rocky

	* src/Makefile.am: Add CDDB_LIB for cdinfo.

2003-04-14 00:29  rocky

	* configure.ac: Check for libcddb and use that if it's there.

2003-04-14 00:27  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: If we don't think this is a cue file, we now
	report that rather than give the cryptic message about a null
	source.

2003-04-14 00:26  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: CDDB lookup for audio CD via libcddb.

2003-04-14 00:24  rocky

	* lib/cdio.c: Bad linux default_device initialization.

2003-04-11 23:38  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.h, cdio.c, cdio.h: Add routine
	cdio_is_bincue to test if file is a cue file.  cdio_open does a
	better job in automatically determining the type of file.

2003-04-11 13:33  rocky

	* lib/: sector.c, sector.h: Tired of all those unused warings.
	Remove the static inline stuff.  It's probably not worth the
	performance gains. (And if it is we can turn into a #define)

2003-04-11 13:31  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: Move used #include <string.h> outside of
	conditional compilation since strdup's used to get default device.

2003-04-11 13:30  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_nrg.c: Forgot to add recently added
	read_audio_sector to op structure.

2003-04-10 03:22  rocky

	* configure.ac, lib/_cdio_bincue.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c: configure.ac:
	bump version bincue/nrg: add cdio_read_audio_sector

2003-04-10 03:19  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: read_mode_audio_sector now works.

2003-04-10 00:13  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_freebsd.c,
	_cdio_generic.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.c, cdio.h,
	cdio_private.h: get_default_device with NULL will get device
	*without* trying to open cd. Add read_audio call.

2003-04-10 00:11  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Add ability to read audio (CD-DA) sector.

2003-04-10 00:10  rocky

	* lib/types.h: Add CDIO_INVALID_LSN definition

2003-04-09 07:15  rocky

	* lib/sector.h: CD_MAX_TRACKS -> CDIO_CD_MAX_TRACKS

2003-04-08 17:30  rocky

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2003-04-08 17:12  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_linux.c: Small name changes.

2003-04-08 06:35  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bsdi.c: Changes brought about by sector.h #define
	changes.

2003-04-08 06:17  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_sunos.c: Revise for changed sector.h

2003-04-07 07:31  rocky

	* lib/cdio_private.h: Add opaque CdIoDataSource type and generic
	free routine for stream-based drivers (nrg, bincue, network).

2003-04-07 07:29  rocky

	* lib/types.h: Indention formatting that Emacs prefers.

2003-04-07 07:25  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_nrg.c: Sync up with _cdio_bincue a little. free routine
	replaced with a generic routine.

2003-04-07 07:24  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Move free routine into a generic routine.
	Some numbers replaced by #define constants.

2003-04-07 07:24  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_generic.c: Add generic_stream_free and remove out of
	disk-image routines.

2003-04-07 07:23  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_stream.h: Opaque type CdioDataSource is now in
	cdio_private.h. This forces us to use that. (And this might not be
	the best, but I can't think of anything else that is as simple.)

2003-04-06 23:05  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_stream.c: Grammar typo.

2003-04-06 22:58  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Another case of not checking the status of
	operations and returning on error (rather than continuing). Not
	serious this time...

2003-04-06 22:41  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Propagate error results from seeks and reads.

2003-04-06 19:40  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_stdio.c, _cdio_stream.c, _cdio_stream.h: Document
	some of the interfaces.

2003-04-06 19:09  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: Back off a little with the #define thing a
	little for now. I made a mistake somewhere.  (And don't want to
	track it down further.)

2003-04-06 14:26  rocky

	* lib/sector.h: This time for sure?

2003-04-06 14:12  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_generic.c, lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c,
	lib/sector.h, src/cdinfo.c: More #define reductions/fixes.

2003-04-06 13:57  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi_old.c,
	lib/_cdio_linux.c, lib/_cdio_nrg.c, lib/_cdio_stream.c,
	lib/_cdio_sunos.c, lib/sector.h, src/cdinfo.c: Change sector.h
	constants, yet again. This time for Herbert Valiero Riedel.

2003-04-06 01:46  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: Use new sector.h constants.

2003-04-06 01:45  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_linux.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.h: 
	Use new sector.h constants. More changes will no doubt follow.

2003-04-06 01:44  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bincue.c: More complete. Fill out seek code.

2003-04-06 01:43  rocky

	* lib/sector.h: Go with Linux definitions rather than invent our
	own. More changes will no doubt follow.

2003-04-04 00:15  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, cdio_private.h: Close go getting simple
	read working. Not completely correct, but close.

2003-04-03 19:41  rocky

	* lib/: cdio.c, cdio.h: Documentation improvment: Note that
	get_default_device returns NULL on error.

2003-04-03 07:16  rocky

	* lib/: Makefile.am, _cdio_stream.h, bytesex.h, bytesex_asm.h,
	cdio.h, cdio_assert.h, cdio_types.h, ds.c, ds.h, logging.h,
	sector.h, types.h: cdio_types.h -> types.h

2003-04-02 09:54  rocky

	* lib/cdio.c: Note that device is uninit when destroying, 'cause it
	is!

2003-03-30 08:01  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_generic.c,
	_cdio_linux.c, _cdio_nrg.c, _cdio_sunos.c, cdio.c, cdio.h,
	cdio_private.h: More common routiens and structures moved to
	cdio_generic.c or cdio_private.h respectively.

2003-03-30 07:59  rocky

	* configure.ac: BSDI now requires Steve Schultz's libdvd.a and
	dvd.h package.

2003-03-29 20:31  rocky

	* configure.ac: Having trouble getting aclocal include libpopt.m4
	(and presumably other *.m4's)

2003-03-29 20:11  rocky

	* autogen.sh, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Rest: add libpopt
	autoconfiguration.

2003-03-29 20:11  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_bsdi.c: Extend to larger interface using generic
	routines.

2003-03-29 19:40  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Yet another typo.

2003-03-29 19:38  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: Change default drive and fix typographical
	mistake.

2003-03-29 16:13  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_bincue.c, _cdio_generic.c, _cdio_nrg.c,
	_cdio_sunos.c: Small lint-like errors. Solaris now works again with
	new read/lseek functions.

2003-03-29 15:28  rocky

	* lib/: _cdio_freebsd.c, _cdio_sunos.c: Probably closer towards
	compiling on those architectures.

2003-03-29 12:32  rocky

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/_cdio_bincue.c,
	lib/_cdio_bsdi.c, lib/_cdio_bsdi_old.c, lib/_cdio_freebsd.c,

	lib/cdio_types.h, lib/sector.h, src/Makefile.am, src/cdinfo.c: Add
	simple (non-mode2) read/seek.  _cdio_generic.c: place to save
	common driver routines add cdio_get_track_sec_count.

2003-03-24 21:10  rocky

	* src/cdinfo.c: gcc < 3.0 compatibility.

2003-03-24 19:00  rocky

	* lib/_cdio_freebsd.c: A stab at FreeBSD support. Not finished.
	More later...

2003-03-24 18:59  rocky

	* lib/: Makefile.am, _cdio_bsdi.c, _cdio_linux.c, cdio.c, cdio.h:
