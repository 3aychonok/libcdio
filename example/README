This directory contains some simple examples of the use of the libcdio
library.

A larger more-complicated example are the cd-drive, cd-info, cd-read,
iso-info and iso-read programs in the src directory.

Descriptions of the programs here are as follows...

cdtext.c: A program to show CD-Text and CD disc mode info.

iso1.c: A program to show using libiso9660 to list files in a
	directory of an ISO-9660 image.

iso2.c: A simple program to show using libiso9660 to extract a file
	from a CDRWIN cue/bin CD image.

iso3.c: A program to show using libiso9660 to extract a file from an
	ISO-9660 image.

scsi-mmc1.c: A program to show issuing a simple SCSI-MMC command (INQUIRY).

scsi-mmc2.c: A more involved SCSI-MMC command to list features from 
	     a SCSI GET_CONFIGURATION command.

sample1.c: A simple program to list track numbers and logical sector
   numbers of a Compact Disc using libcdio.

sample2.c: A simple program to show drivers installed and what the
   default CD-ROM drive is.

sample3.c: A simple program to show the use of cdio_guess_cd_type().
   Figure out the kind of CD image we've got.

sample4.c: A slightly improved sample3 program: we handle cdio logging
   and take an optional CD-location.

sample5.c: A program to show drivers installed and what the default
   CD-ROM drive is and what CD drives are available.
