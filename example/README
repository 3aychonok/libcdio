This directory contains some simple examples of the use of the libcdio
library.

A larger more-complicated example are the cd-info and cd-read programs
in the src directory.

Descriptions of the programs here are as follows...

sample1.c: A simple program to list track numbers and logical sector
   numbers of a Compact Disc using libcdio.

sample2.c: A simple program to show drivers installed and what the
   default CD-ROM drive is.

sample3.c: A simple program to show the use of cdio_guess_cd_type().
   Figure out the kind of CD image we've got.

sample4.c: A slightly improved sample3 program: we handle cdio logging
   and take an optional CD-location.

sample5.c: A program to show drivers installed and what the default
   CD-ROM drive is and what CD drives are available.

sample6.c: A program to show drivers installed and what the default
   CD-ROM drive is and what CD drives are available.
