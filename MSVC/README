Files in this directory are for compiling with Microsoft Visual C.
They are courtesy of John Oseman (mog) and Pete Batard <pete@akeo.ie>.

These project files require Visual Studio 2010 or later.

Two samples are currently provided:
- cd-info provides information about CD and is dynamically linked against
  libcdio.dll (as built by the libcdio solution files)
- extract, which extracts the content of a disc, is statically linked against
  the udf, iso9660 and driver components of libcdio

To compile your own project, you will probably need to add the missing/
directory to your include path, as it provides stdint.h, inttypes.h and
unistd.h that provide some of the missing types required by libcdio.

To link against the DLL, you must define LIBCDIO_DLL as a preprocessor macro.

Also, please note that large file support in MSVC requires the following
preprocessor macros to be defined during compilation:
  _OFF_T_DEFINED
  _off_t=__int64
  off_t=_off_t
  _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

Finally, when using the debug DLL, be mindful that memory allocations from the
runtime library may or may not be able to be freed depending on whether the
debug or release version was invoked, and whether the application itself is
release or debug. Please ensure that you use /MD or /MDd accordingly.
