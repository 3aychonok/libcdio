{"name":"Libcdio","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.sv.gnu.org/libcdio.git","body":"See README.libcdio for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nThe libcdio package contains a library for CD-ROM and CD image\r\naccess. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and\r\ndevice-dependent properties of a CD-ROM or of the specific details of\r\nvarious CD-image formats may benefit from using this library.\r\n\r\nA library for working with ISO-9660 filesystems libiso9660 is\r\nincluded. A generic interface for issuing MMC (multimedia commands) is\r\nalso part of the libcdio library.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a library for working with ISO-9660 filesystems.\r\n\r\nThe CD-DA error/jitter correction library from cdparanoia\r\n(http://www.xiph.org/paranoia) is included as a separate library\r\nlicenced under GPL v2.\r\n\r\nSome support for disk image types like CDRWin's BIN/CUE format,\r\ncdrdao's TOC format, and Nero's NRG format are available. Therefore,\r\napplications that use this library also have the ability to read disc\r\nimages as though they were CD's.\r\n\r\nThe library is written in C, however there are OO C++, Perl, Python\r\nand Ruby wrappers to interface to the library. However C++ is the only\r\none that is bundled with this package, and the interfaces provide only\r\na subset of the full features of the library.\r\n\r\nAlso included in the libcdio package are a number of utility programs:\r\n\r\n* cd-info  - displays CD information: number of tracks, CD-format and \r\n\t     if possible basic information about the format.  If libcddb\r\n             (http://libcddb.sourceforge.net) is available, the cd-info\r\n             program will display CDDB matches on CD-DA discs. And if a\r\n             new enough version of libvcdinfo is available (from the\r\n\t     vcdimager project), then cd-info shows basic VCD information.\r\n\r\n* cd-read  - performs low-level block reading of a CD or CD image, \r\n\r\n* iso-info - displays ISO-9660 information from an ISO-9660 image, \r\n\r\n* iso-read - extracting files from an ISO-9660 image, a version of the\r\n             CD-DA extraction tool cdparanoia which corrects for\r\n             CD-ROM jitter, and a simple curses-based CD player,\r\n             cdda-player using the analog CD-ROM output.\r\n\r\n* cd-paranoia - port of cdparanoia (CD-DA jitter and error correction)\r\n                using libcdio back-end CD-reading. \r\n\r\nThere is very limited low-level support for MMC commands on some\r\nplatforms. Using MMC writing can be done. However there is currently\r\nlittle higher level-support for writing. Other libraries like libburn,\r\nlibdi, libscg, or libdvdread may be helpful.\r\n\r\nSome of the projects using libcdio are the Video CD authoring and\r\nripping tools VCDImager (http://vcdimager.org), a navigation-capable\r\nVideo CD plugin and CD-DA plugins for the media players xine\r\n(http://xinehq.de), videolan's vlc (http://videolan.org), media\r\nplayers mplayerxp (http://mplayerxp.sourceforge.net/) and gmerlin\r\n(http://gmerlin.sourceforge.net), kiso, a KDE GUI for creating,\r\nextracting and editing ISO-9600 images (http://kiso.sourceforge.net),\r\nand a Samba vfs module that allows exporting a CD without mounting it\r\n(http://ontologistics.net/OpenSource/Samba/index.php).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
