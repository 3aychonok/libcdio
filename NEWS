-  add library routine cdio_guess_cd_type to analyze/guess what type of 
-  CD or CD image we've got.

0.62
-  Some minimal documentation. More will follow.
-  Add a simple sample programs.
-  Add a simple regression test driver.
-  "Smart" open was scanning devices rather than devices + image drivers.

0.61
-   Cygwin/MinGW port.
-   get-default-device reworked to be smarter about finding devices.
-   cd-info: add --no-headers. version ID is from package now. Show default

-   API: add routine report if string refers to a device or not
-   Make use of features in libcddb 0.9.4.

0.5
-  Add RPM spec file. Thanks to Manfred Tremmel <Manfred.Tremmel@iiv.de>

0.4
-  More regression tests. 
-  Use pkg-config(1) support
-  NRG may be closer to being correct.
0.3 
-  reduced overall size of package. Some regression moved to a separate (large)
   package.
-  facilitate inclusion into another project's local source tree (e.g. xine)
-  version number in include
-  cdinfo: lists number of CDDB matches, display error message on failure,
   and can set CDDB port and http proxy
-  Bug: Narrow drivers to devices when source is a device.
-  fix some small compile warnings and configure bugs. Require libcddb 0.9.0 
   or greater.

0.2 
-  Added Support for reading audio sectors
-  cdinfo can use libcddb (http://libcddb.sourceforge.net). If installed and
   we have a CD-DA disk, we dump out CDDB information. 
-  Regression tests added. 
-  Don't need to open device to give get a default device.
-  Better device driver selection: We test for file/device-ness. 
-  Bugs fixed (default device name on linux),
