One doesn't have to look hard to find a gap in libcdio or libiso9660. 
All of the API should be finished on all OS's (or the API adjusted).

* Fix the current gaps:

  - SCSI-MMC on OSX,
  - CD-Text support working more often
  - more accurate drive capabilities 
  - more accurate CD track classification (Form 1/2, Mode 1/2)
  - complete the image readers, e.g. "silence" and ability to use
    more than one file in cdrdao.
  - multi-session CDs 
   
* Use libcdio as a cdparanoia back-end and add API for CD-DA reading
  with paranoia support.

* Joliet support for libiso9660.

* Delete files in an iso9660 image (mephisto75 at web.de)

* Add something to show what kind of CD media is in a drive. Ideally: CD
  (purchased), CD Write Once, CD Read/Write, but what is there is
  probably something like Cyanine, PhthaloCyanine, Metallized Azo,
  Advanced PhthaloCyanine, Formazan. See
  http://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_dye.shtml or
  http://www.cd-info.com/CDIC/History/Commentary/Parker/stcroix.html


  The discmode type can be used to classify DVD media and it also
  classifies for CD track formats (in addition to CD *content*
  classification). Note there is nothing for DVD content; see the below
  list of things which probably won't get added.

  Given the mismatch between DVD and CD meanings in discmode, the
  discmode type probably needs to be redone.

* Write a real cue parser and TOC parser using flex and bison (partly done). 
  A pcct grammar is given in cdrdao's trackdb TocParser.g and CueParser.g

* More disk image types in regression testing, like CD-I.

* Convert to use glib, removing ds.h and common routines from vcdimager.

* API overhaul. hvr has expressed interest but it's unlikely he'll ever
  have hthe time to do. It could be done in conjunction with a wrappers
  for C++, Perl, Python, ... The idea is that those interfaces would not
  show the ugliness of the current C interface. For example instead of 
  read_mode2, read_mode1, read_audio, there might be a read(mode, ...).

  - Address static loglevel variable (nboullis at debian.org)

* Some things where libcdio will probably not expand in:
 
  -  DVD things, especially DVD-ROM (use libdvdread) 
  -  writing applications (use cdrdao or cdrtools)
  -  analog CD  (but this one I've been tempted to add for a while)
  -  more proprietary undocumented image format (unless someone else is willing
     to do the work)

It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway...  if there is
something you really want done on the above list or have something
else you want done, it may go a lot faster if you undertake doing it
yourself. Patches are always welcome (and CVS write access is
available for those who have demonstrated reasonable ability through
contributions.)
