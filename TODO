Write a real cue parser and TOC parser using flex and bison (partly done). 
A pcct grammar is given in cdrdao's trackdb TocParser.g and CueParser.g

Once this is done CUE/TOC files can be checked and better automatic
disk-image detection can be done.

Stat CUE/BIN files in is_{bin,cue}file? 

Fill in FreeBSD support. Other OS's (Win32 and OS/X)? 

Better NRG support. TOC.

More disk image types in regression testing, like CD-I.

convert to use glib, removing ds.h and common routines from vcdimager.

API overhaul (HVR). 

Write documentation.
